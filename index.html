    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    
    <p>If you are reading this, then I guess you have quite some free time, eh. 
        I have this awful HTML version of this website whilst I try to learn some basic web development principles (I want to understand that classical "how to center a div" meme).</p>

    <p>Anyways, I'm Nelson, and I'm a tech enthusiast. I hold a BSc in Industrial Engineering with an specialization in IT; and a Master's degree in Data Science, both from Universidad Adolfo IbÃ¡Ã±ez (UAI). 
        Currently working as a Data Engineer at <a href="https://www.buk.cl/"> Buk</a>, and also contributing as a tech reviewer at <a href="https://pisapapeles.net/">Pisapapeles</a>. You can find my LinkedIn <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-s-a7a249bb"> here</a>. </p>
    
    <p>I'm not currently researching, although I have a paper being reviewed. This paper is a result of my thesis work for my master's degree, which was in the field of AI/ML ethics. 
        Hopefully in the future, I will be researching again on another topic related to AI and ML.</p>
    
    <p>In both my professional and personal life, I'm driven by a deep interest in technology and its impact in our world. 
        Here, I'll try to share my experiences, insights, and the lessons I've learned along the way -- although when this website is complete, as I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. ðŸ˜¬</p>

    <p> Oh, and if you're interested, I'm also a massive car enthusiast. I currently own a 2015 Mini JCW, which is a fantastic car to drive. 
        You can follow some of my adventures at my Instagram (@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/supervelocens/">supervelocens</a>). </p>

    <p> That's everything (for now). ðŸ™‚</p>
