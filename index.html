    <h1>Hi!</h1>

    <p>I'm Nelson, and I'm a tech enthusiast. I hold a BSc in Industrial Engineering with an specialization in IT; and a Master's degree in Data Science, both from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI). <br>
        Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at Buk, and I also contribute as a tech reviewer at Pisapapeles.</p>
    
    <p>I'm not currently researching, although I have a paper being reviewed. This paper is a result of my thesis work for my master's degree, which was in the field of AI/ML ethics.<br>
        Hopefully in the future, I will be researching again on another topic related to AI and ML.</p>
    
    <p>In both my professional and personal life, I'm driven by a deep interest in technology and its impact on our world. Here, I'll try to share my experiences, insights, and the lessons I've learned along the way -- although when this website is complete, as I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing :)</p>
