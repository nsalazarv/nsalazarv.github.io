    <h1>Hi! I'm Nelson </h1>

    <p> I hold a BSc in Industrial Engineering with an specialization in IT; and a Master's degree in Data Science, both from Universidad Adolfo IbÃ¡Ã±ez (UAI). 
        Currently working as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.buk.cl/">Buk</a>, and also contributing as a tech reviewer at <a href="https://pisapapeles.net/">Pisapapeles</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I'm not currently researching, although I have a paper being reviewed. This paper is a result of my thesis work for my master's degree, which was in the field of AI/ML ethics. 
        Hopefully in the future, I will be researching again on another topic related to AI and ML.</p>
    
    <p>In both my professional and personal life, I'm driven by a deep interest in technology and its impact in our world. 
        You can find my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-s-a7a249bb">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Oh, and if you're interested, I'm also a massive car enthusiast. I currently drive a 2015 Mini JCW, which is absolutely fantastic. 
        You can follow some of my car-related adventures at my Instagram (@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/supervelocens/">supervelocens</a>). </p>

    <p>That's everything (for now). ðŸ™‚</p>
